# E-commerce Back End Starter Code
## Description 
This challenge required us to use sequelize, async methods, and an understanding of api routes to create a back-end e-commerce tool. With this app, a user is able to create, update, delete and view different types of data: tags, products, and categories. 
## Usage
To use this app, the user must install npm using "npm i". Sequelize must be a package that is required to run and the Insmonia application is useful to test the application's functionality. To start the app, the user must run "npm run seed' in the terminal and then "node server" so that the user can then open up Insomnia with their localhost.
